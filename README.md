# onboarding
# Below is the proposed flow of the onboarding process.

The form is broken into three sections:

Section #1 (Getting to Know You) - Collects basic information on the client(s).
Section #2 (Learning about Your Process) - Collects insights on the prospective client(s).
Section #3 (The Scoop on the Data) - Collects available data (if applicable) from the client(s).

Upon submission, the inputs would then update applicable form feilds from section #1(e.g UserName/Password) in the backend 
of the client dashboard.

Entries from Section #2 provides insights for the Sales team when they decide to follow up with client(s).

Lastly, Entries from Section #3 (data) would be used by the Sales team as well as usable entries in the backend.

## Files/Folders##

# Use the custom.js file to edit javascript.
# Use the custom.css file to edit styling.

#This customization is based on Bootstrap 3.
